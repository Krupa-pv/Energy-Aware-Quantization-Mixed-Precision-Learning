# Lab 4: Limitations and Future Work Analysis for Final Project

**ECSE 397/600: Efficient Deep Learning**  
**Instructor:** Prof. Gourav Datta  
**Due Date:** December 10, 11:59 PM EST

## Overview

The objective of this lab is to help your group critically evaluate the current state of your final project and articulate meaningful directions for improvement. The insights developed here should be directly incorporated into the **Discussion / Limitations / Future Work** section of your final research-style project report, and will also strengthen the quality of your final presentation.

## Submission Details

- **Due Date:** Before your scheduled final project presentation.
- **Format:** PDF document (1-2 pages), one submission per group.
- **Length:** 1-2 pages maximum.

## 1. Identify Key Limitations of Your Current Approach

Each group should clearly identify **at least three significant limitations** of the current project. These may include, but are not limited to:

- **Model limitations:** architectural constraints, lack of robustness, overfitting, slow inference, limited generalization.
- **Dataset limitations:** small dataset size, class imbalance, noisy labels, lack of diversity or domain mismatch.
- **Methodological limitations:** limited ablations, insufficient baseline comparisons, incomplete metrics or evaluation.
- **Implementation limitations:** GPU/CPU memory issues, training instability, limited compute budget.
- **Experimental limitations:** lack of cross-validation, limited hyperparameter sweeps, insufficient qualitative analysis.

> **Be specific and honest.** This section is about critical reflection, not justification.

## 2. Propose Realistic and Meaningful Future Improvements

For each limitation identified above, propose **concrete and feasible improvements**. These may include:

- Enhanced preprocessing or data augmentation pipelines.
- Incorporating improved architectures or more expressive models.
- Adding missing baselines or stronger SOTA comparisons.
- Scaling to larger or more representative datasets.
- Exploring pruning, quantization, or compression techniques.
- Introducing transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, or multimodal extensions.
- Improving metrics (e.g., F1, ROC-AUC, energy evaluation, robustness analyses).
- Deploying the model on edge hardware or evaluating real-time performance.

> This section should demonstrate your understanding of how the project could evolve into a more complete research pipeline.

## 3. Reflection on Project Progress

Provide a short reflection (3-5 sentences) addressing:

- What aspects of the project were unexpectedly easy or difficult.
- What design decisions you might change if starting again.
- Any surprising results or observations encountered so far.
